# audioNormalizer
Simple node.js script that uses ffmpeg to normalize audio levels across multiple mp3 files.

Input mp3 files should go into the directory named 'input', output audio files would be placed into the 'output' directory

FFmpeg should go into the directory named ffmpeg in the same folder as the compiled script.
